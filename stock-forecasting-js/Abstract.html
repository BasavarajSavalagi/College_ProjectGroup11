		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>Share market prediction is the demonstration of
attempting to decide the real time value of a organization
stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial
exchange using tools and techniques of Machine Learning. In
this paper we propose a Machine Learning approach that will
be trained from the accessible stocks data and gain
intelligence and then uses the acquired knowledge for an exact
prediction. This model predicts the stock prices using different
datasets (for example : nasdaq finance, yahoo finance and
google finance) and regression technique. The goal of this
model is to analyze the historical data and predict the real time
stock prices accurately.</p>
